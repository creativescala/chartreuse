# Themes

Theming controls colors, fills, and other similar aspects of the visual appearance of plots.
There are two concepts that combine in Chartreuse's theme system:

- themes, which specify collections of values to control the visual appearance of plots; and
- @:api(chartreuse.Themeable) values, which allow the user to override the theme values with settings of their own choice.
